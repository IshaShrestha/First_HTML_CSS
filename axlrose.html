<h2><b>Biography</b></h2><br>

<p>Founder and lead singer of Guns N' Roses, Axl Rose is a celebrated but controversial figure in the world of rock.<br>
Axl Rose was born on February 6, 1962, in Lafayette, Indiana. He eventually moved to California, working odd jobs<br>
and playing in bands until the formation of Guns N' Roses in the mid-1980s. GNR achieved critical acclaim, but Roseâ€™s<br>
antics caused controversy. After the Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose became a recluse. He resurfaced occasionally, with<br>
the band, promising to release the album Chinese Democracy, which finally hit stores in 2008. After much speculation,<br>
    in March 2016 it was announced that GNR would be reuniting for a North American tour.</p>
